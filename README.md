What Predicts Greater LGBT rights

Merging together a bunch of disparate datasets that have data that may be of interest to those people studying the progress of states in recognizing the rights of LGBT individuals. 

There are three data sources. 

1. The [Movement Advancement Project](http://lgbtmap.org/equality-maps/legal_equality_by_state) has created a scale of LGBT rights by state. I had coded that into an excel sheet. 
2. The religious census data comes form [the ARDA.](http://www.thearda.com/Archive/Files/Descriptions/RCMSCY10.asp) I'm specifically interested in the rate of evangelicals. 
3. A database of [state ideology scores.](https://rcfording.wordpress.com/state-ideology-data/) Higher numbers = a more liberal state.
